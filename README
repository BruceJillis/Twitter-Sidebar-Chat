Twitter Sidebar Chat

This tool adds a simple chat widget to the context sensitive sidebar of #newtwitter just like a twitpic or plixi image gets displayed inline. It allows you to create and broadcast
webchat urls simply. For people that don't have the widget, clicking on the link will lead to a full page version of the same chat.

This repository contains 2 seperate tools: 
	a greasemonkey 'plugin' for #newtwitter that adds a new 'chat' mediatype and some simple support for managing and creating chats
	a simple and small appengine webservice that supplies the chat API and widgets
